    <p>Hi, my name is <b>Mindaugas Jasiulis</b>, I am student and self-taught web developer currently working on small projects and maintaining Reddit community forum on the side. I've had experience working with various experts in their particular fields and i've gained additional insight because of that which helped me to move forward quicker.</p>
	<p>One of the best experiences developing was on Reddit community forum <a href="https://windows10.reddit.com" target="_blank">/r/Windows10</a> due its big audience. I made its community interaction grow with the help of color coding and helpful hints in certain parts of the subreddit. Im happy that my work has reaches over <b>1 million unique users</b> every month on this community alone and occasional private messages from users that like my design are just hearth warming, those people drive me even further to improve my work and continue learning and trying new things. Not to mention that I've even received some job offers from some of the people that loved my design and everything I did on this community forum. Also thanks to this my side project i've had plenty of interaction with Microsoft employees and had some feedback and help from them on certain things.

    <h2>Windows 10 subreddit</h2>
        <a href="/images/w10.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/w10.png" alt="Windows 10 community forum" class="img-responsive"></a>
<p><a title="Windows 10 subreddit" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10" target="_blank">Windows 10 subreddit</a> was designed out of passion, I enjoy and use software that Microsoft makes and because of that im passionate about it so I discuss, rant and provide feedback on a daily basis. My main goal on this community forum was to design this subreddit from scratch and come up with a way to highlight certain content which people enjoy. I've managed to do that by enforcing flairs system with a help of a BOT and automatically highlighting<i>(gave it a distinctive background in the main view of the forum)</i> threads based on their assigned flair.</p>

    <div class="project">
    <h2>Bookie.GG</h2>
     <a href="/images/bookie.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/bookie.png" alt="Bookie.GG gambling site" class="img-responsive"></a>
<p><b>Bookie.GG</b> was my first big project with a proper team which featured web developers, lawyer, designers, community manager. <b>Bookie.GG</b> is a gambling site in which you are able to bet Counter-Strike: Global Offensive weapon skins, which can be traded, sold. CS GO skins hold monetary value on the market. We collaborated with 1HP developers which also promoted our site and got us on board of CS:GO radio project. 1HP at the time was one of the most well known CS GO esport applications.</p>

    <h2>Regional park</h2>
        <a href="/images/gamta.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="/images/gamta.PNG" alt="Regional park site" class="img-responsive"></a>
<p>This <b>prototype site</b> was originally made for Lithuanian regional park as an example of what i could make if they get funding for the website from European Union. Unfortunately local area regional park didn't receive funding from European Union for the website so i had to work on my personal and low key projects.</p>
  </div>
        <div class="project">
    <h2>ClearShift</h2>
     <a href="/images/clearshift.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/clearshift.png" alt="ClearShift site" class="img-responsive"></a>
    <p><b>ClearShift</b> is a site for promoting my third major version of my Reddit theme which I originally made for /r/MicrosoftBand community, I put a lot of hours into it, so I wanted to out source it and make it easy to customize, set up with pre-set code snippets so even people with little to no CSS knowledge can use <b>ClearShift</b> and customize it to their needs. Also broadening the reach of my <b>ClearShift</b> theme helps me to improve it even further due to feedback and bug reports. Also im using this site to promote other subreddits that use <b>ClearShift</b> so people can see how it looks in action.</p>
